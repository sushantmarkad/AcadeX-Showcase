## 🚀 Key Features & Gallery

### 1️⃣ The Student Experience
**Gamified Learning & Task Management:**
Students don't just attend; they engage. The dashboard allows students to view pending tasks and earn **XP (Experience Points)** for completing curriculum activities, gamifying the academic journey.

### 2️⃣ Teacher Command Center
**Smart Attendance (Anti-Proxy Technology):**
Our core feature uses a double-layer verification system:
1.  **Dynamic QR:** The attendance code refreshes every **10 seconds**, preventing students from sharing screenshots.
2.  **Geofencing:** The system validates that both the student and teacher are within a **100-meter radius**. Attendance is only marked if location data matches.
